**MULTI-LAYER RESONANT**

**Problem Statement**

When astronauts explore space, particularly Mars, fine dust particles build up on the rover surface and solar panels. This reduces the energy generation and damages or obstructs the rover's precise scientific instruments. Dust removal methods (e.g., brushes or gas blowers) are normally heavy, use power, or wear out quickly. Therefore, need a lightweight, energy-efficient, autonomous approach to keep surfaces clean.


**Proposed Solution**

This project proposes a smart surface coating that can shed the dust using resonance.

The rover surface will be covered in thin films (piezoelectric layers PDMS embedded in Aluminum Fiber sheets).

Dust integrity will be monitored using sensors (High-resolution CMOS scientific camera).

Once the sensor (CREMA) detects that dust accumulation has crossed the threshold, an alert signal is sent to the resonant system, which then gets triggered to generate vibrations, causing the dust particles to fall off

**Self-Directed Visual Observation through Deep Neural Networks**

A ResNet18 CNN backbone employing deep residual learning architecture for autonomous visual perception.

An end-to-end feature abstraction (raw edges,pixels → textures → semantic cues of dust).

Transforms raw pixel information into latent representations for a perception system that classifies clean vs. dust regardless of increasing noise due to the environment and light.

This sizes works in varying light and environmental noise without adaptations and handcrafted methods.


**Smart Decision-Making Using Probabilistic Thresholding**


Produces a probabilistic dust score (0-1) as opposed to a standard yes/no value.

Uses thresholding (e.g., 0.7) when providing alerts based on context. 

Prevents false alerts by taking confidence levels into account.  

Minimizes redundant cleaning cycles and energy consumption. 

Ensures surface reliability of rovers operations in extreme extraterrestrial environments.




**Materials Used**

Base Substrate: Kapton/Aluminum sheet (lightweight; durability in Martian environment).

Functional Layer: PVDF or PZT (Piezoelectric films for resonance).

Reinforcement: Graphene/nanotube thin coating (for strength & dust repellance).

Sensors:High-resolution CMOS scientific camera .


**Process Flow**

Dust Accumulates on rover surface.

Sensors identify how thick dust layer is/reflectiveness.

AI Decision → compares amount of dust to a threshold.

Trigger → Activates piezoelectric films.

Resonance Vibrations → Shakes dust off.

Surface Restored → Clean and effective for solar panels/instruments.


**Advantages**

 Minimal weight and power.
 
 Dust removal is autonomous and AI-driven.
 
 No mechanical wear (e.g., brushes, etc.).
 
 Effective in MT hard environments.
 
 Increases time rover can operate.

 
**Applications**

Space rovers (solar panels, cameras, sensors).

Surface protection for spacecraft.
