**MULTI-LAYER RESONANT**

**Problem Statement**

When astronauts explore space, particularly Mars, fine dust particles build up on the rover surface and solar panels. This reduces the energy generation and damages or obstructs the rover's precise scientific instruments. Dust removal methods (e.g., brushes or gas blowers) are normally heavy, use power, or wear out quickly. Therefore, need a lightweight, energy-efficient, autonomous approach to keep surfaces clean.


**Proposed Solution**

This project proposes a smart surface coating that can shed the dust using resonance.

The rover surface will be covered in thin films (piezoelectric layers (PVDF or PZT) embedded in Kapton/Aluminum sheets).

Dust integrity will be monitored using sensors (optical backscatter + capacitive).

AI will be used to process the sensor data and determine when the dust has exceeded a defined threshold.

Once the threshold has been met, the piezoelectric films will generate resonant vibrations to shake off the dust particles that had been accumulated on the surface without damaging the surface of the rover.

The process mimics the behavior of a snake shedding its skin. Instead of peeling, the material uses a controlled resonance to automatically clean itself.


**Materials Used**

Base Substrate: Kapton/Aluminum sheet (lightweight; durability in Martian environment).

Functional Layer: PVDF or PZT (Piezoelectric films for resonance).

Reinforcement: Graphene/nanotube thin coating (for strength & dust repellance).

Sensors: Optical dust detection + capacitive layer sensing.


**Process Flow**

Dust Accumulates on rover surface.

Sensors identify how thick dust layer is/reflectiveness.

AI Decision → compares amount of dust to a threshold.

Trigger → Activates piezoelectric films.

Resonance Vibrations → Shakes dust off.

Surface Restored → Clean and effective for solar panels/instruments.


**Advantages**

 Minimal weight and power.
 
 Dust removal is autonomous and AI-driven.
 
 No mechanical wear (e.g., brushes, etc.).
 
 Effective in MT hard environments.
 
 Increases time rover can operate.

 
**Applications**

Space rovers (solar panels, cameras, sensors).

Surface protection for spacecraft.
